GO-FUSE: native bindings for the FUSE kernel module.

See passthrough.go for a file system that exercises all available
functionality.  To test it, a tool is provided to mount a local
directory as a loopback:

  (cd example ; gomake)
  mkdir mountpoint
  ./example/main -debug -threaded=false mountpoint /directory/of/some/other/project
  (cd mountpoint ; ls)

on my machine, compiles over loopback (threaded, without debug) are
about 10x slower compared to normal compiles.

Tested on:

- x86 32bits (Fedora 14). 
- x86 64bits (Ubuntu Lucid).
