GO-FUSE: native bindings for the FUSE kernel module.

See passthrough.go for a file system that exercises all available
functionality.  To test it, a tool is provided to mount a local
directory as a loopback:

  (cd example ; gomake)
  mkdir mountpoint
  ./example/loopback -debug -threaded=false mountpoint /some/other/directory &
  (cd mountpoint ; ls)

Tested on:

- x86 32bits (Fedora 14).
- x86 64bits (Ubuntu Lucid).


LICENSE

Like Go, this library is distributed under the new BSD license.  See
accompanying LICENSE file.


BENCHMARKS

In benchmarks, Go-fuse's loopback system is about 10 times slower than
equivalent C++ based FUSE filesystem.  In practical applications, the
the file system client processing may mask some of these performance gaps.

KNOWN PROBLEMS

Grep source code for TODO.  Major topics:

* Missing support for file locking: FUSE_GETLK, FUSE_SETLK, FUSE_SETLKW

* Missing support for extended attributes FUSE_SETXATTR, FUSE_LISTXATTR

* Missing support for FUSE_INTERRUPT, FUSE_NOTIFY, CUSE, BMAP, POLL, IOCTL

* Missing support for doing GetAttr/SetAttr on opened files.
