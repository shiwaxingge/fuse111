GO-FUSE: native bindings for the FUSE kernel module.

GETTING STARTED

* examplelib/zipfs.go contains a small and simple read-only filesystem
  for zip files. The corresponding command is in example/zipfs/ . For
  example,

    mkdir /tmp/mountpoint
    example/zipfs/zipfs /tmp/mountpoint file.zip &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    fusermount -u /tmp/mountpoint

* fuse/loopback.go supports all the implemented functionality.  A
  binary to run is in example/loopback/ . For example

    mkdir /tmp/mountpoint
    example/loopback/loopback -debug /tmp/mountpoint /some/other/directory &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    fusermount -u /tmp/mountpoint


Tested on:

- x86 32bits (Fedora 14).
- x86 64bits (Ubuntu Lucid).



BENCHMARKS

In benchmarks, Go-fuse's loopback system is less than 2 times slower
than equivalent C++ based FUSE filesystems.  In practical applications,
the the file system client processing may mask some of these
performance gaps.

BUGS

Yes, probably.  Report them through golang-nuts@googlegroups.com.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

Grep source code for TODO.  Major topics:

* Missing support for file locking: FUSE_GETLK, FUSE_SETLK, FUSE_SETLKW

* Missing support for extended attributes FUSE_SETXATTR, FUSE_LISTXATTR

* Missing support for FUSE_INTERRUPT, FUSE_NOTIFY, CUSE, BMAP, POLL, IOCTL

* Missing support for doing GetAttr/SetAttr on opened files.
