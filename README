GO-FUSE: native bindings for the FUSE kernel module.


HIGHLIGHTS

* High speed: less than 25% slower than libfuse, using the gc
compiler.  For almost all real world applications, the difference will
be negligible.

* Supports in-process mounting of different FileSystems onto
subdirectories of the FUSE mount.

* Includes two fleshed out examples, zipfs and unionfs.


EXAMPLES

* examplelib/zipfs.go contains a small and simple read-only filesystem
  for zip files. The corresponding command is in example/zipfs/ . For
  example,

    mkdir /tmp/mountpoint
    example/zipfs/zipfs /tmp/mountpoint file.zip &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    fusermount -u /tmp/mountpoint

* Zipfs is also used for benchmarking: a script to measures threaded
  stat performance is in example/benchmark.sh.  A libfuse baseline is
  given by running the same test against archivemount 
  (http://www.cybernoia.de/software/archivemount/).

  Currently, zipfs/Go-FUSE is about 20% slower than
  archivemount/libfuse..
  
* examplelib/multizipfs.go shows how to use in-process mounts to
  combine multiple Go-FUSE filesystems into a larger filesystem.
    
* fuse/loopback.go mounts another piece of the filesystem.
  Functionally, it is similar to a symlink.  A binary to run is in
  example/loopback/ . For example

    mkdir /tmp/mountpoint
    example/loopback/loopback -debug /tmp/mountpoint /some/other/directory &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    fusermount -u /tmp/mountpoint

* unionfs/unionfs.go: implements a union mount using 1 R/W branch, and
  multiple R/O branches.

    mkdir -p  /tmp/mountpoint /tmp/writable
    example/unionfs/unionfs /tmp/mountpoint /tmp/writable /usr &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    ls -l /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    rm /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    ls -l /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    cat /tmp/writable/*DELETION*/* 

* union/autounionfs.go: creates UnionFs mounts automatically based on
  existence of READONLY symlinks.


Tested on:

- x86 32bits (Fedora 14).
- x86 64bits (Ubuntu Lucid).

BUGS

Yes, probably.  Report them through golang-nuts@googlegroups.com.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

Grep source code for TODO.  Major topics:

* Missing support for file locking: FUSE_GETLK, FUSE_SETLK, FUSE_SETLKW

* Missing support for FUSE_INTERRUPT, FUSE_NOTIFY, CUSE, BMAP, POLL, IOCTL, STATFS
