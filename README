GO-FUSE: native bindings for the FUSE kernel module.

See passthrough.go for a file system that exercises all available
functionality.  To test it, a tool is provided to mount a local
directory as a loopback:

  (cd example ; gomake)
  mkdir mountpoint
  ./example/main -debug -threaded=false mountpoint /some/other/directory &
  (cd mountpoint ; ls)

Tested on:

- x86 32bits (Fedora 14). 
- x86 64bits (Ubuntu Lucid).

BENCHMARKS

The speed of go-fuse is close to libfuse's speed (measurements on my
lenovo T60 laptop):

* 'find' in tree with 14k files. fs access: 0.06s, go-fuse: 3.5s, bbfs: 3.9
* 'ls -lR' in same tree:  fs access: 0.5s, go-fuse: 9.5s, bbfs: 8.8s
* copying a 100 mb file: fs access: 200mb/s, go-fuse: 182mb/s, bbfs: 190mb/s

bbfs is a loopback filesystem written in C, see
http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~pfeiffer/fuse-tutorial.tgz

BUGS

Yes, probably.  Report them through golang-nuts@googlegroups.com. 


KNOWN PROBLEMS

Grep source code for TODO.  Major topics:

* Missing support for file locking: FUSE_GETLK, FUSE_SETLK, FUSE_SETLKW

* Missing support for extended attributes FUSE_SETXATTR, FUSE_GETXATTR, FUSE_LISTXATTR

* Missing support for FUSE_INTERRUPT, FUSE_NOTIFY, CUSE, BMAP, POLL, IOCTL

* Missing support for doing GetAttr/SetAttr on opened files.
